There are three folders and named properly.
I have attached PPT for better understanding of concepts.

1. ANF Folder
Inside ANF folder there are two python file named as "sbox3 and ANF"
sbox3.py is used for creating boolean function from 3-Bits Sbox.
ANF.py is used to create polynomial from boolean function that is nothing but ANF form in crypto term.
Note that you can use PRESENT sbox in code (ANF.py) to generate ANF form of PRESENT sbox.
How to understand the output, I have already explained in PPT please go through it.

2. Division Propery Folder
In this folder there is file div_property.py used to verify whether a multiset X has division property or not.
To understand concept please go through PPT.

3. Linear Inequalities Generation Folder

In this folder there is a python file main.py used to convert non-zero entry of DDT Table into points.
That points are used to generate linear inequalities using sage.
So another file is "Inequality_gen.sage" which is used to generate linear inequalities using sage.

Note: make sure you have install sageMath in you system.
command to run file: sage Inequality_gen.sage

You will get set of linear inequalities.

All the best!
